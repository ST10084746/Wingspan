## Basic Info


This mobile app is designed for Bird watching enthusists. It Helps its users find any hotspots that are located 
within a specific range from where they are located. It also allows them to log any observatios they may have seen.
These observations can be viewd at a later date since they are stored in an online database. 

Once the user opens the applicatin they are prompted to register. If they are already registered they may login.
After they log in they are shown to to the map page where hotspots are marked on the map. The user can select a hotspot
on the map and get directions to the selected hotspot from their current location. The tab next to the map tab displays 
the list of observations which the user will have saved. The tab next to the list allows the user add any other
observations they wish to add. Lastly the furthest tab contains the settings. The user can edit the maximum range 
where the hotspots can be searched for as well as switch the unit of measurement between miles and kilometeres
